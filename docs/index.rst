``Jdaviz`` is a package of astronomical data analysis visualization
tools based on the Jupyter platform.  These GUI-based tools link data
visualization and interactive analysis.  They are designed to work
within a Jupyter notebook cell, as a standalone desktop application,
or as embedded windows within a website -- all with nearly-identical
user interfaces.

``jdaviz`` applications currently include tools for interactive
visualization of spectroscopic data.  SpecViz is a tool for
visualization and quick-look analysis of 1D astronomical spectra.
MOSViz is a visualization tool for many astronomical spectra,
typically the output of a multi-object spectrograph (e.g., JWST
NIRSpec), and includes viewers for 1D and 2D spectra as well as
contextual information like on-sky views of the spectrograph slit.
Cubeviz provides of view of spectroscopic data cubes (like those to be
produced by JWST MIRI), along with 1D spectra extracted from the cube.
