.. note::

   ``jdaviz`` is one tool that is part of STScI's larger `Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis>`_.


``jdaviz`` is a package of astronomical data analysis visualization
tools based on the Jupyter platform.  These GUI-based tools link data
visualization and interactive analysis.  They are designed to work
within a Jupyter notebook cell, as a standalone desktop application,
or as embedded windows within a website -- all with nearly-identical
user interfaces.

``jdaviz`` applications currently include tools for interactive
visualization of spectroscopic and imaging data. :ref:`specviz` is
a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis of 1D astronomical
spectra. :ref:`mosviz` is a visualization tool for many astronomical
spectra, typically the output of a multi-object spectrograph (e.g.,
JWST NIRSpec), and includes viewers for 1D and 2D spectra as well as
contextual information like on-sky views of the spectrograph slit.
:ref:`cubeviz` provides a view of spectroscopic data cubes (like those
to be produced by JWST MIRI), along with 1D spectra extracted from the
cube. :ref:`imviz` is a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis
for 2D astronomical images.

JWST Instrument Modes in Jdaviz
===============================

This tool is designed with instrument modes from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in mind, but
the tool should be flexible enough to read in data from many astronomical telescopes.  The table below
summarizes Jdaviz file support specific to JWST instrument modes.
