``jdaviz`` is a package of astronomical data analysis visualization
tools based on the Jupyter platform.  These GUI-based tools link data
visualization and interactive analysis.  They are designed to work
within a Jupyter notebook cell, as a standalone desktop application,
or as embedded windows within a website -- all with nearly identical
user interfaces.

``jdaviz`` applications currently include tools for interactive
visualization of spectroscopic and imaging data.
:ref:`imviz` is a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis for 2D astronomical images.
:ref:`specviz` is a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis of 1D astronomical spectra.
:ref:`cubeviz` provides a view of spectroscopic data cubes (like those
to be produced by JWST MIRI), along with 1D spectra extracted from the
cube.
:ref:`mosviz` is a visualization tool for many astronomical
spectra, typically the output of a multi-object spectrograph (e.g.,
JWST NIRSpec), and includes viewers for 1D and 2D spectra as well as
contextual information like on-sky views of the spectrograph slit.

.. warning::

   As of ``jdaviz`` version 3.5, python 3.8 is no longer supported. Please use python 3.9 or
   greater to get the latest bug fixes and feature additions for ``jdaviz``.

.. note::

   ``jdaviz`` is one tool that is part of STScI's larger
   `Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis>`_.

   Recordings and instructional notebooks from live Jdaviz tutorials can be found at
   `the JWebbinar website <https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/jwebbinars>`_
   under the "Materials and Videos" expandable section. Scroll down to the bottom of that section
   to find materials from the most recent session (JWebbinar 24, March 2023).

JWST Instrument Modes in Jdaviz
===============================

This tool is designed with instrument modes from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in mind, but
the tool should be flexible enough to read in data from many astronomical telescopes.  The table below
summarizes Jdaviz file support specific to JWST instrument modes.
