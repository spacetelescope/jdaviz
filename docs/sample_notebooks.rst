``jdaviz`` is one tool that is part of STScI's larger `Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis>`_.

These tools include three types of example Jupyter notebooks.

1. `Sample notebooks <https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/tree/main/notebooks>`_ that illustrate how to use Jdaviz and various API calls. These notebooks are located in the ``notebooks`` sub-directory
of the git repository.

2. `Sample notebooks <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis/example-jupyter-notebooks-data-analysis-tools>`_ that illustrate likely science workflows with data obtained from the various JWST instruments. These notebook incorporate astropy and jdaviz when possible.

3. `Sample notebooks <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline-overview/example-jupyter-notebooks-running-the-pipeline>`_ that illustrate how to run the JWST science calibration pipeline.
