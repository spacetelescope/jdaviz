Sample Notebooks
================

``jdaviz`` is one tool that is part of STScI's larger `Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis>`_.

These tools include three types of example Jupyter notebooks.

1. :gh-tree:`Sample Jdaviz Notebooks <notebooks>` that illustrate how to use Jdaviz and various API calls. These notebooks are located in the ``notebooks`` sub-directory of the git repository.

2. `Sample JDAT notebooks <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis#JWSTPostPipelineDataAnalysis-JWSTdataanalysis(JDAT)notebooks>`_ that illustrate likely science workflows with data obtained from the various JWST instruments. These notebooks incorporate ``astropy`` and Jdaviz when possible.

3. `Sample JWST pipeline notebooks <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline/jwst-pipeline-notebooks>`_ that illustrate how to run the JWST science calibration pipeline.
