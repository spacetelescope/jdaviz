Saving the State of Your Jdaviz Session
***************************************

While Jdaviz has no :guilabel:`Save` button, the various data products created
within Jdaviz can be :ref:`exported to the notebook or file <specviz-export-data>`.

This is the suggested workflow to ensure reproducibility in your
analysis without having to retrace your steps in Jdaviz each time you run a notebook.
We also encourage users to manually record steps in their Jupyter notebook
(or anywhere of convenience) with any details that may be of interest when
running Jdaviz.
