.. _ramp-extraction:

Ramp Extraction
===============

Extract a ramp from a ramp cube.

Data products from infrared detectors flow through the official
:ref:`JWST <jwst:user-docs>` or
`Roman <https://roman-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ mission pipelines in levels. Infrared detectors use
an "up-the-ramp" readout pattern, which is summarized in the
`JWST documentation <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/understanding-exposure-times>`_.

The Ramp Extraction plugin is a quick-look tool, and it does not support all of the features of the mission pipelines.
The mission pipelines produce rate images from ramp cubes by fitting the samples up the ramp while accounting for
non-linearity, jumps detected during an integration, saturation, and detector defects. These data quality checks and
corrections are not applied in the Ramp Extraction plugin. For details on how rate images are derived from ramps, see
the JWST pipeline's :ref:`jwst:ramp_fitting_step` step or the Roman pipeline's
:ref:`romancal:ramp_fitting_step` step.
