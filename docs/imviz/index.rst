Imviz is a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis of 2D astronomical
images. Like the rest of `jdaviz`, it is written in the Python programming
language, and therefore can be run anywhere Python is supported
(see :doc:`../installation`). (TODO: Add content.)


Using Imviz
-----------

To run Imviz from the command line::

    jdavis --layout=imviz <filename>

To run Imviz in a notebook::

    from jdaviz import Imviz
    imviz = Imviz()
