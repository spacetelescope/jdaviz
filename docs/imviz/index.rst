Imviz is a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis of 2D astronomical
images. Like the rest of `jdaviz`, it is written in the Python programming
language, and therefore can be run anywhere Python is supported
(see :doc:`../installation`). Imviz is built on top of the
`astrowidgets <https://astrowidgets.readthedocs.io>`_ using
`Ginga <https://ginga.readthedocs.io>`_ backend, providing a visual,
interactive interface to the analysis capabilities in that library.

Imviz allows images to be easily displayed and examined. It supports WCS,
GWCS, ASDF, and so on. (TODO: Add content.)
