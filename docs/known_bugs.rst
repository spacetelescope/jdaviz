Known Issues
============

You can `report an issue to the Jdaviz GitHub issues <https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/issues/new>`_.

Some currently known but unresolved common issues that users encounter
are as follow in their respective categories. This list is not exhaustive,
so please also consult `existing Jdaviz GitHub issues <https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/issues/>`_
as well if you are unable to find your issue here:

.. _known_issues_installation:

Installation
------------

On MacOS versions 10.13 and older, install fails due to scikit-image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This can be fixed by reinstalling scikit-image:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall scikit-image
    conda install scikit-image

The reason for this issue is that prebuilt binaries for scikit-image don't
work on Mac versions of 10.13 or older and conda installs an older
version of scikit-image that works with those versions.
Another way to get the up-to-date scikit-image version is:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U --no-binary scikit-image scikit-image.

Although this solution takes much longer (~5 minutes) to install than the
first solution.

On some platforms, install fails due to vispy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 0.6.4 version of vispy fails to build for some combinations of
platform/OS and Python versions. vispy 0.6.5 has resolved this, but a
workaround if you have an older version of vispy is to ensure you have a
compatible version:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n jdaviz python=3.8
    conda activate jdaviz
    pip install vispy>=0.6.5
    pip install jdaviz --no-cache-dir

See `Issue #305 <https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/issues/305>`_ for
updates on this topic.

On some platforms, install fails due to bottleneck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a conda environment, where numpy was installed using conda, installing
jdaviz using pip will attempt to pull bottleneck from PyPI. This might result
in bottleneck trying to build numpy from source and crash, stalling the
installation altogether. When this happens, exit the installation, install
bottleneck with conda, and try to install jdaviz again.

.. _known_issues_app:

Application-wide
----------------

Lab fails to start with IndexError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some environments, you occasionally might not able to start Jdaviz in 
Jupyter Lab due to this error::

    IndexError: pop from an empty deque

This is an upstream issue at https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/11934
that is not related to Jdaviz. The workaround is to find another environment
where you do not see this error or use Jupyter Notebook instead.

.. _known_issues_cubeviz:

Cubeviz
-------

Cubeviz sometimes fails to run from command line interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running Cubeviz from the command line sometimes results in a failure
to initialize the app in the browser due to a ``RuntimeError`` in
``tornado/ioloop.py``. We are investigating, but in the meantime
reinstalling fresh in a new conda environment may help. Alternatively,
running Cubeviz in a Jupyter notebook instead of from the command line
will circumvent the problem.

Spectrum does not appear when running on a Linux VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running Jdaviz on a Linux virtual machine (VM), the spectrum may not appear
in the spectrum viewer. This is a 
`known bug <https://github.com/glue-viz/bqplot-image-gl/issues/94>`_ in an underlying
package. Until it is fixed, the workaround is to run the following in a Jupyter
notebook cell *before* importing ``jdaviz``:

.. code-block:: python

    from glue_jupyter.bqplot.profile import layer_artist
    layer_artist.USE_GL = False

Collapse and Moment Maps: Spectral bounds do not match Region selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When trying to do a second collapse with the same spectral region, but with
resized bounds: change to Region=None, resize the region, then reselect Region 1,
the region bounds are correct. However, applying Collapse again, it errors out and
the image viewer that contained the initial collapse goes blank.

Cube viewer contrast changes when collapsing Jupyter scroll window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to see the full Cubeviz app in a Jupyter notebook, one can click on
the side of the cell output to collapse or expand the scrollable window. This
has the unintended consequence of changing the contrast of the image displayed
in the Cubeviz cube viewer.

.. _known_issues_imviz:

Imviz
-----

add_markers may not show markers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some OS/browser combinations, ``imviz.add_markers(...)`` might take a few tries
to show the markers, or not at all. This is a known bug reported in
https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-jupyter/issues/243 . If you encounter this,
try a different OS/browser combo.

.. _known_issues_specviz:

Specviz
-------

Spectrum does not appear when running on a Linux VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the identically named issue in :ref:`known_issues_cubeviz`.

Line List Plugin redshift and radial velocity do not roundtrip to full precision
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Giving a redshift value will report a converted radial velocity, which if entered manually will not 
convert to the exact same redshift value.  Note that the redshift value is always treated as the
true value and used when plotting lines, etc.
