Displaying Spectra
******************

The spectra linked to the source selected in the table viewer will be automatically displayed
in the viewers. Both spectra will populate the top right viewer with the 2D spectra
appearing above its 1D counterpart.

        Specviz documentation on displaying spectra.

The functionality of the Specviz API can be accessed in Mosviz via
the `~jdaviz.configs.mosviz.helper.Mosviz.specviz` attribute, e.g.,
``mosviz.specviz.get_spectra()``.

Pan/Zoom
========

For an overview on general pan/zoom functionality, please see :ref:`imviz_pan_zoom`

Synchronous Spectral Pan/Zoom
-----------------------------
Mosviz assumes the 1D and 2D spectra objects share a relationship in spectral space.
As a result, the 1D and 2D spectral viewers have their spectral axes (the horizontal x-axis) linked.
As you pan and zoom in spectral space (horizontally) in either of the two spectral viewers,
the other will follow, simultaneously panning and zooming by the same amounts.
