Jdaviz is designed to be integrated into existing `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_! To do so, install Jdaviz in your notebook's Python environment and add a new cell wherever you would like to use Jdaviz.  For example::

    # Import Specviz
    from jdaviz import Specviz
    # Instantiate an instance of Specviz
    myviz = Specviz()
    # Display Specviz
    myviz.app   #doctest: +SKIP

Similarly, you can open instances of :ref:`mosviz-notebook`, :ref:`cubeviz-notebook`, and Imviz.
