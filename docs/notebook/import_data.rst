Specific instructions on exporting data from Jdaviz to your
notebook vary slightly for each instance of Jdaviz, including
for :ref:`Specviz <specviz-import-api>`, :ref:`Cubeviz <cubeviz-import-api>`,
:ref:`Mosviz <mosviz-import-api>`, and :ref:`Imviz <imviz-import-api>`.
These instructions all provide the ability to import data with
the GUI or the API via the Jupyter notebook.
