Data Analysis Plugins
*********************

The Cubeviz data analysis plugins include operations on
`~specutils.Spectrum1D` one dimensional datasets.
Plugins that are specific to 1D spectra are described in
more detail under :ref:`Specviz: Data Analysis Plugins <specviz-plugins>`.  All plugins
are accessed via the :guilabel:`plugin` icon in the upper right corner
of the Cubeviz application.

.. _cubeviz-export-plot:

Export Plot
===========

This plugin allows exporting the plot in a given viewer to various image formats.

.. _cubeviz-plot-options:

Plot Options
============

This plugin gives access to per-viewer and per-layer plotting options.

.. _slice:

Slice
=====

The slice plugin provides the ability to select the slice
of the cube currently visible in the image viewers, with the
corresponding wavelength highlighted in the spectrum viewer.

.. image:: img/slice_plugin.png

The slider can be grabbed to scrub through the cube.  To choose
a specific slice, enter a slice number (integer) or an approximate
wavelength (in which case the nearest slice will be selected and 
the wavelength entry will update to the exact value of that slice).

The spectrum viewer also contains a tool to allow clicking and 
dragging in the spectrum plot to choose the currently selected slice.
When the slice tool is active, clicking anywhere on the spectrum viewer
will select the nearest slice across all viewers, even if the indicator
is off-screen.

Gaussian Smooth
===============

Gaussian smoothing can be applied either to the spectral
or spatial dimensions of a cube.  Spectral smoothing is
described in more detail under :ref:`Specviz: Data Analysis
Plugins: Gaussian Smoothing <gaussian-smooth>`.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`Gaussian Smooth <gaussian-smooth>`
        Specviz documentation on gaussian smoothing of 1D spectra.

.. _collapse:

Collapse
===============

.. image:: ../img/collapse_plugin.png

The Collapse plugin collapses a spectral cube along
the wavelength axis to create a 2D spatial image.
For spatial axes, the full extent of the selected dimension
is included in the collapse. For the spectral axis, a wavelength
range for collapse can be specified using a spectral subset or
by entering the wavelength range manually.

To make a 2D image, first go to the Collapse plugin and
select the cube dataset using the
:guilabel:`Data` pulldown. Next, select the method
for collapse (Mean, Median, Min, Max, or Sum) in the
:guilabel:`Method` pulldown. To collapse a limited spectral subregion,
you can either create and select a
:guilabel:`Region` in the spectrum viewer, or enter the lower and
upper spectral bounds manually. When you :guilabel:`APPLY` the
Collapse, a 2D image is created. You can load this into any image
viewer pane to inspect the result.  For example, the Collapse Sum
over an emission line is shown in the middle image viewer of
the above figure.

.. _model-fitting:

Model Fitting
=============

The Model Fitting plugin is described in more detail by the
Specviz:Data Analysis Plugins:Model Fitting documentation.
For Cubeviz, there is an additional option to fit the model over each individual spaxel by
pressing :guilabel:`Apply to Cube`.  The fit parameter planes are saved in a data structure
that can be accessed in a jupyter notebook. The best model fit, evaluated over the cube is
also saved to a dataset with the label specified in the :guilabel:`Model Label` field (default 'Model').

.. seealso::

    :ref:`Model Fitting <specviz-model-fitting>`
        Specviz documentation on fitting spectral models.

As mentioned in the :ref:`specviz-model-fitting` section for Specviz, models can be accessed
in a Jupyter notebook by using the following code::

    cubeviz.get_models(model_label="Model", x=10)

Where the ``model_label`` keyword identifies which model should be returned and the ``x`` and
``y`` keywords identify specifically which spaxel fits are to be returned, for models
applied to every spaxel using the :guilabel:`Apply to Cube` button. Leaving ``x`` or
``y`` as `None` will mean that the models fit to every spaxel across that axis will be
returned. Model parameters can also be accessed using the following code::

    cubeviz.get_model_parameters(model_label="Model", y=52)

With the parameters following the same pattern as the
:meth:`~jdaviz.core.helpers.ConfigHelper.get_models` method.

Contours
========
.. image:: img/contours_activated.png

Contours of an image can be generated and overplotted on that image.  Go
to the :guilabel:`Layer` tab in the image viewer settings window under the 
|icon-settings-sliders| icon. To activate :guilabel:`Contours`,
click on the :guilabel:`Eye with a cross` icon and choose either the :guilabel:`Linear` icon
for auto-contours or the :guilabel:`Custom` icon to set your own levels. The specified levels
will appear as labeled, color-coded contours in the image viewer, on top of the image.

The :guilabel:`Contours` of a second image can also be plotted over a first image or cube. Add
the second image as data in the data drop-down tab, and select both images. To visualize the contours
of the second image, go to the :guilabel:`Layer` tab, select the layer to be contour-mapped, and
set its :guilabel:`Contour` to be on and its :guilabel:`Bitmap` to be off. The contours of
the second image will appear superimposed on the first image. In the second figure below, we
show the contours of an image generated using the Collapse plugin plotted over leftmost cube
viewer.  If you overplot them on a cube, the contours will remain unchanged as you scrub through
the cube.

.. _moment-maps:

Moment Maps
===========

.. image:: ../img/moment1_map.png

The Moment Maps plugin can be used to create a 2D image from
a data cube. Mathematically, a moment is an integral
of a 1D curve multiplied by the abscissa to some power. The plugin
integrates the flux density along the spectral axis to compute
a moment map. The order of the moment map (0, 1, 2, ...) indicates
the power-law index to which the spectral axis is raised.  A 'moment 0' map
gives the integrated flux over a spectral region. Similarly, 'moment 1'
is the flux-weighted centroid (e.g., line center) and 'moment 2'
is the dispersion (e.g., wavelength or velocity dispersion)
along the spectral axis.  Moments 3 and 4 are less commonly utilized,
but correspond to the skewness and
kurtosis of a spectral feature.

To make a moment map, first go to the Moment Maps plugin and
select the cube dataset using the :guilabel:`Data` pulldown.
To specify the spectral feature of interest, you can either create
and select a :guilabel:`Region` in the spectrum viewer, or enter
the lower and upper spectral bounds manually in the plugin.
Next, enter the :guilabel:`Moment` index to specify the order
of the moment map.   When you press :guilabel:`CALCULATE`, a 2D moment
map is created. You can load this into any image
viewer pane to inspect the result. You can also save the result to
a FITS format file by pressing :guilabel:`SAVE AS FITS`.

For example, the middle image viewer in the screenshot above shows the Moment 1 map
for a continuum-subtracted cube.  Note that the cube should first be
continuum-subtracted in order to create continuum-free moment maps of an
emission line. Moment maps of continuum emission can also be created, but
moments other than moment 0 may not be physically meaningful.  Also note
that the units in the moment 1 and moment 2 maps reflect the units of the spectral
axis (Angstroms in this case). The units of the input cube should first be
converted to velocity units before running the plugin if those units are
desired for the output moment maps.

Line or Continuum Maps
======================

.. image:: ../img/moment0_line_map.png

There are at least three ways to make a line map using
one of three Cubeviz plugins: :ref:`Collapse <collapse>`,
:ref:`Moment Maps <moment-maps>`,
or :ref:`Model Fitting <model-fitting>`.
Line maps created using the first two methods require an
input data cube that is already continuum-subtracted.  Continuum
maps can be created in a similar way for data that is not
continuum-subtracted.

To make a line or continuum map using the :ref:`Collapse Plugin <collapse>`, first
import a data cube into Cubeviz.  Next, go to the
Collapse plugin and select the input data using the
:guilabel:`Data` pulldown. Then set the :guilabel:`Axis` to the
wavelength axis (e.g. 0 for JWST data) and the method to 'Sum'
(or any other desired method). Next either create and select a
:guilabel:`Region` in the spectrum viewer, or enter the lower and upper
spectral bounds manually. When you :guilabel:`Apply` the Collapse, a 2D image
of the spectral region is created. You can load this line map in any image
viewer pane to inspect the result.

A line map can also be created using the :ref:`Moment Maps Plugin <moment-maps>` using a
similar workflow. Select the (continuum-subtracted) dataset in the
Plugin using the :guilabel:`Data` pulldown.  Then either select a
subset in the Spectral Region pulldown or enter the lower and upper
spectral bounds. Enter '0' for :guilabel:`Moment` and press
:guilabel:`Calculate` to create the moment 0 map. The resultant 2D
image is the flux integral of the cube over the selected spectral
region, and may be displayed in any image viewer, as shown in the
middle image viewer in the figure above.

The third method to create a map is via the :ref:`Model Fitting Plugin <model-fitting>`.
First create and fit a model (e.g. a Gaussian plus continuum model)
to an individual spectrum. Next, fit this model to every spaxel in
your data cube. The resultant model parameter cube can be retrieved
in a notebook. The line or continuum flux in each spatial pixel
can then be computed by integrating over the line or continuum
spectral region of interest.
