# Notebook Based Cubeviz

## Install requirements

This is probably more than is required to just run in a notebook but for now, try this...

  * Install NPM (https://nodejs.org/en/) system wide (*not* a pip install)
  * `conda create -n jdaviz-dev python`
  * `conda activate jdaviz-dev`  if conda is kinda new else: `source activate jdaviz-dev`
  * `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/jdaviz`
  * `cd jdaviz`
  * `pip install -e .`

## Example CubeViz Notebook

There is an example CubeViz notebook in the `examples/` directory to try out.  Change the filename location to point to 
a dataset on your system.

To run the notebook:
  * `conda activate jdaviz-dev`
  * `cd jdaviz/exmaples`
  * `jupyter notebook`
  
Then go into your favorite browser, go into the `cubeviz-example.ipynb` and execute each cell.
