    "# Synthetic image and cutout creation for Mosviz pipeline data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: The synthetic dataset we currently possess from the JWST data pipeline team for use in Mosviz contains simulated spectra from NIRSpec but no associated NIRCam photometry. We would like to have test imagery to display in Mosviz alongside these 2D and 1D spectra since we are not aware that the pipeline team has plans to produce any.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Populate an image of background noise with properly-scaled galaxy cutouts sourced from a Hubble Space Telescope image and placed at their analogous locations in the new image. These galaxies' real spectra do not necessarily correspond with those in our dataset, but we care more about the veneer of having photometry to match with our spectra in Mosviz at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution**: We pull our galaxy cutouts and catalog information from the Hubble Deep Field image. _(Formerly used ASTRODEEP's image of the [Abell 2774 Parallel](http://astrodeep.u-strasbg.fr/ff/?img=JH140?cm=grayscale) and [MACS J0416.1-2403 Parallel](http://astrodeep.u-strasbg.fr/ff/?ffid=FF_M0416PAR&id=1264&cm=grayscale).)_ We use `photutils` to select bright sources from the image for use in our own. We sought to use [Artifactory](https://bytesalad.stsci.edu/ui/repos/tree/General/jwst-pipeline%2Fdev%2Ftruth) to obtain a range of RA/Dec over which to project our synthetic image, but that information was absent. Instead, we place the image over a manually chosen RA/Dec range and place the cutouts in randomly selected locations within that field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues**:\n",
    "- We wanted to scrape RA/Dec information from the data pipeline products to get a range of coordinates over which to scale our synthetic image, but it appears that the pipeline's data products lack `\"TARG_RA\"` or `\"TARG_DEC\"` keywords in their headers.\n",
    "    - The data products also do not appear to have WCS information. Though it is not strictly needed to achieve this notebook's goals, it would be convenient to have.\n",
    "- There does not appear to be an observation with Level 2 data in `jwst-pipeline/truth/test_nirspec_mos_spec2` and Level 3 data in `jwst-pipeline/truth/test_nirspec_mos_spec3`. All observations are either Level 2 only or Level 3 only.\n",
    "- _(Resolved)_ A good number of the cutouts from the first couple of field images we tested had intrusions from other galaxies due to crowding. We settled on the Hubble Deep Field as a good source image, but had we not, we may have considered using galaxies modeled with Sersic profiles to get cleaner cutouts to inject into our synthetic image."

    "### Import packages\n",
    "\n",
    "- `os` helps us create a new directory for the final cutouts from the synthetic image.\n",
    "- `glob.glob` lists local files that match a given pattern.\n",
    "- We use `astropy.units` to convert between degrees and arcseconds.\n",
    "- `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` helps merge lists of right ascensions (RA) and declinations (Dec) into one object.\n",
    "- `astropy.convolution.Gaussian2DKernel` smooths two-dimensional data by performing convolutions with two Gaussian functions.\n",
    "- We use `astropy.io.fits` to read in existing FITS files and write a new one with the synthetic image.\n",
    "- The objects from `astropy.nddata` assist in creating cutouts once we have identified galaxies to take from the field image and also with re-importing our synthetic image.\n",
    "- The `sigma_*` methods from `astropy.stats` work with image data that is clipped to within a certain number of deviations from the mean. `gaussian_fwhm_to_sigma` is a float for converting full width at half maximum values to standard deviations from the image mean.\n",
    "- The objects from `astropy.table` help with reading an modifying tabular data.\n",
    "- We download a copy of the Artifactory spectra with `astropy.utils.data.download_file`.\n",
    "- `astropy.wcs.WCS` creates a World Coordinate System object that is useful for transforming on-sky data from one patch to another.\n",
    "- `pathlib.Path` allows for the creation of file paths that work across operating systems.\n",
    "- The objects from `photutils.segmentation` do the work of analytically finding bright sources, separating those that overlap, and creating a catalog of the resulting information.\n",
    "- We use `matplotlib.pyplot` to preview the field image, the cutouts, and various stages of our synthetic image.\n",
    "- We use `numpy` to facilitate several specialized mathematical and array-related operations.\n",
    "- `zipfile` assists with unzipping the downloaded Artifactory files.\n",
    "- Finally, `%matplotlib inline` is notebook \"magic\" that helps display in-notebook plots consistently for different users."
