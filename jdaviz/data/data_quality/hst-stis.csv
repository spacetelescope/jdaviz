flag,description,name
0,Error in the Reed-Solomon decoding (an algorithm for error correction in digital communications).,
1,Lost data replaced by fill values.,
2,"Bad detector pixel (e.g., bad column or row, mixed science and bias for overscan, or beyond aperture).",
3,Data masked by occulting bar.,
4,Pixel having dark rate > 5-sigma times the median dark level.,
5,"Large blemish, depth > 40% of the normalized p-flat (repeller wire).",
6,Vignetted pixel,
7,Pixel in the overscan region.,
8,"Saturated pixel, count rate at 90% of max possible local non-linearity turns over and is multi-valued; pixels within 10% of turnover and all pixels within 4 pixels of that pixel are flagged.",
9,Bad pixel in reference file.,
10,"Small blemish, depth between 40% and 70% of the normalized flat. Applies to MAMA and CCD p-flats.",
11,">30% of background pixels rejected by sigma-clip, or flagged, during 1-D spectral extraction.",
12,Extracted flux affected by bad input data.,
13,Data rejected in input pixel during image combination for cosmic ray rejection.,
14,Extracted flux not CTI corrected because gross counts are <= 0.,
