``jdaviz`` is a package of astronomical data analysis visualization tools based on the Jupyter platform. It is one tool that is a part of STScI's larger `Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis>`_. These GUI-based tools link data
visualization and interactive analysis.  They are designed to work
within a Jupyter notebook cell, as a standalone desktop application,
or as embedded windows within a website -- all with nearly-identical
user interfaces. ``jdaviz`` is under active development, and users who
encounter bugs in existing features are encouraged to open issues in this
repository.

``jdaviz`` provides data viewers and analysis plugins that can be flexibly
combined as desired to create interactive applications that fit your workflow.
Several named preset configurations for common use cases are provided:

* **Specviz**: Visualization and quick-look analysis of 1D astronomical spectra.
* **MOSviz**: Visualization tool for many astronomical spectra,
  typically the output of a multi-object spectrograph (e.g., JWST
  NIRSpec), and includes viewers for 1D and 2D spectra as well as
  contextual information like on-sky views of the spectrograph slit.
* **Cubeviz**: View of spectroscopic data cubes (like those to be
  produced by JWST MIRI), along with 1D spectra extracted from the cube.
* **Imviz**: Visualization and quick-look analysis of 2D astronomical images.

Contributing
------------

We love contributions! jdaviz is open source,
built on open source, and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

Note: This disclaimer was originally written by
`Adrienne Lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend>`_ for a
`PyCon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo>`_, and was adapted by
jdaviz based on its use in the README file for the
`MetPy project <https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy>`_.
