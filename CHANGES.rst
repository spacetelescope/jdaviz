New Features
------------
- Stretch bounds tool now enables dynamic adjustment of spline knots. [#2545, #2623]

- Stretch histogram shows a spinner when the histogram data is updating. [#2644]

- "Export Plot" plugin is now replaced with the more general "Export" plugin. [#2722, #2782]

- "Export" plugin supports exporting plugin tables, plugin plots, data, and
  non-composite spatial subsets.[#2755, #2774, #2760, #2772, #2770, #2780, #2784]

- Opening a plugin in the tray (from the API or the toolbar buttons) now scrolls to that plugin.
  [#2768]

Cubeviz
^^^^^^^

- Calculated moments can now be output in velocity units. [#2584, #2588, #2665, #2697]

- Added functionality to Collapse and Spectral Extraction plugins to save results to FITS file. [#2586]

- Moment map plugin now supports linear per-spaxel continuum subtraction. [#2587]

  both the slider and slice-index input. [#2715]

Imviz
^^^^^

- There is now option for image rotation in Orientation (was Links Control) plugin.
  This feature requires WCS linking. [#2179, #2673, #2699, #2734, #2759]

- Add "Random" colormap for visualizing image segmentation maps. [#2671]

- Enabling any matched zoom tool in a viewer disables other matched zoom tools in other viewers
  to avoid recursion. [#2764]

Specviz2d
^^^^^^^^^

- Spectral extraction plugin: highlighting of active header section. [#2676]

API Changes
-----------

- ``width`` argument in Line Analysis plugin is renamed to ``continuum_width`` and ``width``
  will be removed in a future release. [#2587]

- New API access to ``viz.data_labels``, ``viewer.data_labels_visible``, and
  ``viewer.data_labels_loaded``. [#2626]

Cubeviz
^^^^^^^

- ``spatial_subset`` in the spectral extraction plugin is now renamed to ``aperture`` and the deprecated name will
  be removed in a future release. [#2664]

- Slice plugin's ``wavelength``, ``wavelength_unit``, and ``show_wavelength`` are deprecated in favor
  of ``value``, ``value_unit``, and ``show_value``, respectively.  ``slice`` is also deprecated
  and should be replaced with accessing/setting ``value`` directly. [#2706, #2715]

- Disabled exporting spectrum-viewer to PNG in Cubeviz; pending investigation/bugfix. [#2777]

Imviz
^^^^^

- Links Control plugin is now called Orientation. [#2179]

- Linking by WCS will now always generate a hidden reference data layer
  without distortion. As a result, when WCS linked, the first loaded data
  is no longer the reference data. Additionally, if data is distorted,
  its distortion will show when linked by WCS. If there is also data without WCS,
  it can no longer be displayed when WCS linked. [#2179]

- ``imviz.link_data()`` inputs and behaviors are now consistent with the Orientation plugin. [#2179]

  to always display ``flux density`` no matter the input unit. [#2703]

==================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix app top-bar alignment in popouts and when embedded in websites. [#2648]

Mosviz
^^^^^^

- Matched mouseover indicator to show same position in 1d and 2d spectral viewers. [#2575]

Specviz2d
^^^^^^^^^

- Matched mouseover indicator to show same position in 1d and 2d spectral viewers. [#2575]

API Changes
-----------

- Deprecated ``app.get_data_from_viewer`` is removed, use ``viz_helper.get_data`` instead. [#2578]

- Deprecated ``app.get_subsets_from_viewer`` is removed, use ``viz_helper.get_subsets`` instead. [#2578]

Imviz
^^^^^

  the currently selected viewer. [#2541]

Other Changes and Additions
---------------------------

- Better handling of non-finite uncertainties in model fitting. The 'filter_non_finite' flag (for the
  LevMarLSQFitter) now filters datapoints with non-finite weights. In Specviz, if a fully-finite spectrum
  with non-finite uncertainties is loaded, the uncertainties will be dropped so every datapoint isn't
  filtered. For other scenarios with non-finite uncertainties, there are appropriate warning messages
  displayed to alert users that data points are being filtered because of non-finite uncertainties (when
  flux is finite). [#2437]

- Add swatches to color picker. [#2494]

- Plot options now includes better support for scatter viewers, including toggling line visibility. [#2449]

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug which did not update all references to a viewer's ID when
  updating a viewer's reference name. [#2479]

  failed to properly update the selection. [#2505]

Cubeviz

  image viewers while spectral subsets were defined. [#2527]

Imviz
^^^^^

Mosviz
^^^^^^

Specviz
^^^^^^^

- Spectrum that has incompatible flux unit with what is already loaded

  and popout windows. [#2295]

Cubeviz
^^^^^^^

  aperture is not supported. [#2276, #2287]

Mosviz
^^^^^^
