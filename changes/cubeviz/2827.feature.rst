Automatic spectral extraction now goes through the logic of the spectral extraction plugin for self-consistency.  This results in several breaking changes to data-labels and ``get_data`` (the extracted spectra are now given dedicated data-labels instead of referring to them by the label of the flux cube) as well as to several plugins: model fitting, gaussian smooth, line analysis, and moment maps.
